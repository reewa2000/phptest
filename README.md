DESCRIPTION:

    This is a Snippet of code to demonstrate using  Google Maps and OSM API. 
	In this Script PHP Array is used to store Latitude and Longitude for the given address (ie., city being search).


TO TEST:
 
	1. Run the index.php in localhost.
	2. Enter the city name in City Text Box
	3. Click on the Search Button
	
	On a valid city Name both google maps and osm maps will be updated in web page.
	

OTHER INFORMATION:
	1. Openstreetmap is blocking the usuage of free api if frequently used without proper email.So a static emailid is provided.
	2. Geocoding required billing to be enabled to use the api. So Geocode api usuage class is created and sample usuage shown.
